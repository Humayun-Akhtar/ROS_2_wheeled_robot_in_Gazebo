# About the Project
The projects in this repository is a reimplementation of the ROS projects in the tutorial Exploring ROS using a two-wheeled robot by Marco Arruda with few changes to make it executable with the ROS neotic. 
This uses a two-wheeled robot to show the features and tools provided by ROS. Further, the project implements the concepts related to 

Building a robot using URDF and Xacro and controlling it in virtual Gazebo world
Simulating a robot in Gazebo
Develop motion plan algorithms of obstacle avoidance, navigation and mapping for the 2 wheeled robot

By using the codes in this repository, you can run the ROS packages in your local machines provided that you have ROS installed.

# Usage
Clone the codes
```ruby
cd catkin_ws/
```
```ruby
cd src/
```
```ruby
git clone https://github.com/Humayun-Akhtar/ROS_2_wheeled_robot_in_Gazebo.git
```
```ruby

```
Build the ROS packages
```ruby
